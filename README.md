This is an accelerometer/gyro/temperature sensor paired with an STM32 ARM cortex-M0 microcontroller. The microcontroller simplifies the sensor data and makes it compatible with EZ-builder.

A unique feature of this design is that it connects directly to a visual interface and automatically outputs ptich and roll angles in EZ-Builder.
